## 2.1-1

### Question
Using Figure 2.2 as a model, illustrate the operation of INSERTION-SORT on the array A = {31, 41, 59, 26, 41, 58}

### Answer
```
{31, 41*, 59, 26, 41, 58}

{31, 41, 59*, 26, 41, 58}

{31, 41, 59, 26*, 41, 58}
 ||  ||  ||  ||
 | --^ --^ --^|
 ^------------

{26, 31, 41, 59, 41*, 58}
             ||  ||
	     | --^|
	     ^----

{26, 31, 41, 41, 59, 58*}
                 ||  ||
		 | --^|
		 ^----

{26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59}
```

## 2.1-2

### Question
Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of non-decreasing order

### Answer
[2.1-2.sc](../implementations/insertionSort/2.1-2.sc)
```
7c7
<       while(j>=0 && a(j) > toInsert) {
---
>       while(j>=0 && a(j) < toInsert) {
```

## 2.1-3

### Question
Consider the searching problem:

__Input:__ A sequence of _n_ numbers _A = {a1, a2,...., an}_ and a value _v_

__Output:__ An index _i_ such that _v = A[i]_ or the special value `NIL` if _v_ does not appear in _A_

Write pseudocode for __linear search__, wich scans through the sequence, looking for _v_. Using a loop invariant, prove that your algorithm is correct. Make sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.


### Answer
```
FIND(A, v)
	for(i = 0 until A.length)
		if(A[i] == v) 
			return v
	return NIL
```
